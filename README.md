To recreate the exact same feeling of the original NES Tetris I based
myself mostly on the following article https://meatfighter.com/nintendotetrisai/?a=b#Dropping_Tetriminos
which describes in extreme detail and with the original source code 
how everything works, from the timings to the distribution of the pieces.
Some other details where entirely recreated by me
through extreme observation, such as the exact pixel distance between
the board and the tiles, among other things. While I tried to explain
most things through the code, should the reader have any doubt,
please consult the above given article to understand why some
things were made a certain way!
